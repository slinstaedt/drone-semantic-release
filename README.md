# drone-semantic-release

Some simple wrapper for https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version allowing to bump the project version to the next one based on semantic version compatible commit comments.

This image is usable 
- from command line by specifying relevant parameters as docker run parameter
- as drone plugin by specifying settings in .drone.yml
